InterruptTestCode.c
This file contains a test code that prints the value of a counter that increments every second caused by a delay for easier debugging. Pin 3 is set as an input pin, and once the code detects a rise, an interrupt will occur where a function occurs to fix the issue. In this test code, all I have done is print a message that says the problem has been fixed. In reality, we would like to turn on a water pump for a fixed time. 

InterruptTestCode.h
This file is the header file for the c file above. This contains all the definitions of the pin numbers.
